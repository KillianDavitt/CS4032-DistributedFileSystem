\section{Distro File System}
\label{sec-1}

\section{Features we want:}
\label{sec-2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Login
\item Open
\item Close
\item Read
\item Write
\end{itemize}

\section{It does not matter how our dfs is implemented or designed, as long as it implements the above features and is reasonable}
\label{sec-3}


\section{There are 2 main models of distributed file system}
\label{sec-4}

\subsection{NFS Model}
\label{sec-4-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Smart Proxy
\item Just forward all the requests
\item Read ops on a file immediately pushed to server
\item Write ops immediately pushed to server
\item And so on\ldots{}..
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AFS Model}
\label{sec-4-2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Open and Close go across network
\item Read and Write don't
\item Caching strategy
\item Cache locally, modify and push file when done
\item Possibility for files to go out of sync - think github merge
\item Whoever writes back their file first overwrites the server version
\item This is called session semantics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The session problem also occurs in NFS}
\label{sec-4-3}
\begin{itemize}
\item However, systems where this happens should more likely be using a database, not a distro file system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why do people use afs?}
\label{sec-4-4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed for larger userbases
\item The idea is that most people will not modify the files, but they will want to read them.
\item (Think .exe's and such)
\item Better use of caching, much less bandwith use than NFS
\end{itemize}

\section{Our DFS}
\label{sec-5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Think of AFS and NFS as two extremes in the spectrum of distributed file systems
\item Either full caching or no caching
\item "A good dfs will fall somewhere between these"
\item This is a choice we will make for our own filesystems
\item Maybe changes get pushed in time intervals, push new data every 2 minutes?
\end{itemize}

\section{directory Server}
\label{sec-6}
\begin{itemize}
\item A directory server is a server in the distributed file system that stores the actual location of all the files, across all the servers
\item A user asks the directory server for a file and it transparantly retrieves it from wherever it is
\end{itemize}

\section{Locking}
\label{sec-7}
\begin{itemize}
\item We could introduce a locking server
\item We could also leave this to the individual file servers to manage their own locks
\item "Normal strategy" is to put the locking for all the files in the one service
\end{itemize}

\section{Authentication}
\label{sec-8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication server
\item A user logs in to the authentication server
\item How do we let all the other servers know that the user has authenticated
\item MORE to come here!\% Created 2016-11-14 Mon 11:48
