* Distro File System

* Features we want:
 - Login
 - Open
 - Close
 - Read
 - Write

* It does not matter how our dfs is implemented or designed, as long as it implements the above features and is reasonable


* There are 2 main models of distributed file system

** NFS Model
 - Smart Proxy
 - Just forward all the requests
 - Read ops on a file immediately pushed to server 
 - Write ops immediately pushed to server
 - And so on.....

** AFS Model
 - Open and Close go across network
 - Read and Write don't
 - Caching strategy
 - Cache locally, modify and push file when done
 - Possibility for files to go out of sync - think github merge
 - Whoever writes back their file first overwrites the server version
 - This is called session semantics.

** The session problem also occurs in NFS
 - However, systems where this happens should more likely be using a database, not a distro file system

** Why do people use afs?
 - Designed for larger userbases
 - The idea is that most people will not modify the files, but they will want to read them.
 - (Think .exe's and such)
 - Better use of caching, much less bandwith use than NFS

* Our DFS
 - Think of AFS and NFS as two extremes in the spectrum of distributed file systems
 - Either full caching or no caching
 - "A good dfs will fall somewhere between these"
 - This is a choice we will make for our own filesystems
 - Maybe changes get pushed in time intervals, push new data every 2 minutes?

* directory Server
 - A directory server is a server in the distributed file system that stores the actual location of all the files, across all the servers
 - A user asks the directory server for a file and it transparantly retrieves it from wherever it is

* Locking
 - We could introduce a locking server
 - We could also leave this to the individual file servers to manage their own locks
 - "Normal strategy" is to put the locking for all the files in the one service

* Authentication
 - Authentication server
 - A user logs in to the authentication server
 - How do we let all the other servers know that the user has authenticated
